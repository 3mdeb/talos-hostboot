             *      master processor.  This should NOT be used to determine
             *      whether security is enabled, because several conditions are
             *      aggregated together to determine that.  To query whether
             *      security is actually enabled or not, call the enabled() API.
             *      This is a limited-use API intended to be called by trusted
             *      boot code to determine whether a system shipped with a
             *      secure jumper applied or removed, in order to decide
             *      whether to enforce the "TPM Required" policy or not.
             *  @return Boolean indicating acting master processor's secure
             *      jumper state
             *  @retval true Jumper is configured to request HW security.  This
             *      does not necessarily imply security is enabled, because an
             *      open SBE can override the HW policy.  Use the getEnabled()
             *      API to determine whether security is actually enabled.
             *  @retval false Jumper is configured to disble HW security.
