#        to be used when preparing the output file's binary image. This function
#        will only emit the binaries for the firmware portion of the BPM update.
#        The final binary will be organized in the following way:
#        Byte 1:     Major version number (MM)
#        Byte 2:     Minor version number (mm)
#        Byte 3-4:   N number of blocks in the file (NN NN)
#        Byte 5-EOF: Blocks of the form:
#                  BLOCK_SIZE      Byte 1: X number of bytes in block excluding
#                                          this byte. (XX)
#                  ADDRESS_OFFSET  Byte 2-3: Original address offset of the
#                                            first data byte. (AD DR)
#                  DATA_BYTES      Byte 4-X: Firmware data bytes (DD)

=head1 NAME

buildBpmFlashImage.pl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

buildBpmFlashImage.pl [..]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--help>

Prints a brief help message and exits.

=item B<--man>

Prints the manual page and exits.

=item B<--output-dir>

Path to directory to emit the output files to.

=item B<--image>

File containing a BPM flash update script.  More than one --image
argument can be provided.  If no images are supplied, the script will do
nothing.

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<buildBpmFlashImage.pl> will process a set of one or more BPM flash update
scripts in .txt format by transforming the lines of text into blocks of binary
data of the form BLOCK_SIZE, ADDRESS_OFFSET, PAYLOAD. The final binary output by
this script will have the first 2 bytes be the version info (first byte Major,
second Minor), then followed by two bytes that give the number of blocks in the
file, and the remainder of the file will be blocks organized in the following
way:

BLOCK_SIZE is the number of bytes following the BLOCK_SIZE byte.
ADDRESS_OFFSET is the offset the PAYLOAD data originally came from within the .txt file.
PAYLOAD is the data, along with the ADDRESS_OFFSET, that will be used to construct the payloads to send to the BPM to perform the update.
